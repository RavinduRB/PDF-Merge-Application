The other day I made a PDF merging application using Python ðŸš€.

This allows you to merge any PDF you want via the "Upload PDFs" button, and you can rearrange the PDF order by clicking the "Move Up" and "Move Down" buttons.

After creating the PDF order, you can merge it by clicking the "Merge PDFs" button. You can save the PDF prepared in this way.

This was very useful for me in several works at university.

### Libraries Required:
1. **`tkinter`**: For the GUI.
2. **`PyPDF2`** or **`pypdf`**: For PDF merging, handling PDF metadata, and supporting password-protected PDFs.
3. **`pdf2image`**: For previewing PDF pages.
4. **`Pillow`**: For working with PDF images during the preview.
5. **`asyncio`**: For asynchronous operations and preventing the GUI from freezing during long tasks.
6. **`os`**: For file path handling.
7. **`io`**: For handling in-memory file operations (like PDF merging).

### Plan for Features:
We will implement each feature iteratively, ensuring the non-functional requirements such as performance, error handling, and security are met.

### Code Structure:

- **App Structure**:  
   We will follow an event-driven model using `tkinter` and async functions for long-running tasks (like merging large PDFs). Here's a rough breakdown:
   - **File Uploader**: Handle multiple file uploads using file pickers and drag-and-drop.
   - **File Validator**: Check for file format (PDF) and size restrictions.
   - **File Reordering**: Provide a listbox or drag-and-drop interface for users to reorder files before merging.
   - **PDF Merging**: Handle merging, including password-protected PDFs and preserving document properties and formatting.
   - **PDF Preview**: Enable users to preview the entire merged document.
   - **File Download**: Allow the user to download the final merged PDF.

### Steps for Implementation:

#### 1. **Upload PDFs**
   - **File Picker with Multi-Selection**:
     ```python
     from tkinter import filedialog

     def upload_pdfs():
         files = filedialog.askopenfilenames(
             title="Select PDF files", 
             filetypes=[("PDF files", "*.pdf")])
         validate_files(files)
     ```
   - **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**:
     - We can use `tkinterdnd2` or similar libraries to implement drag-and-drop for file uploads.

   - **File Format & Size Validation**:
     ```python
     import os

     def validate_files(files):
         valid_files = []
         for file in files:
             if file.lower().endswith(".pdf") and os.path.getsize(file) <= 100 * 1024 * 1024:
                 valid_files.append(file)
             else:
                 print(f"{file} is not valid.")
         return valid_files
     ```

#### 2. **Reorder PDFs**
   - **Drag-and-Drop Reordering**:
     Implement a listbox with drag-and-drop to reorder the files. Tkinter's `Listbox` widget will be customized for this purpose.

#### 3. **Merge PDFs**
   - **Merge Functionality** (Basic merging using `PyPDF2` or `pypdf`):
     ```python
     from PyPDF2 import PdfMerger

     def merge_pdfs(files, output_filename):
         merger = PdfMerger()
         for pdf in files:
             merger.append(pdf)
         with open(output_filename, 'wb') as f_out:
             merger.write(f_out)
         merger.close()
     ```

   - **Handling Password-Protected PDFs**:
     ```python
     def merge_protected_pdfs(files, passwords, output_filename):
         merger = PdfMerger()
         for i, pdf in enumerate(files):
             reader = PdfReader(pdf)
             if reader.is_encrypted:
                 reader.decrypt(passwords[i])
             merger.append(reader)
         with open(output_filename, 'wb') as f_out:
             merger.write(f_out)
         merger.close()
     ```

#### 4. **Preview Merged PDF**
   - Use `pdf2image` and `Pillow` to generate image previews of the PDF pages:
     ```python
     from pdf2image import convert_from_path
     from PIL import ImageTk, Image

     def preview_pdf(file):
         images = convert_from_path(file)
         for image in images:
             # Convert the image to a format that tkinter can display.
             img = ImageTk.PhotoImage(image)
             display_preview(img)
     ```

#### 5. **Download Merged PDF**
   - **Single-Click Download**: Use a save dialog and download the merged PDF:
     ```python
     from tkinter import filedialog

     def save_merged_pdf():
         output_file = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(
             defaultextension=".pdf", 
             filetypes=[("PDF files", "*.pdf")])
         if output_file:
             merge_pdfs(valid_files, output_file)
     ```

#### 6. **Progress Indicator**
   - Use `asyncio` to process large file merges in the background without freezing the GUI:
     ```python
     import asyncio

     async def merge_large_pdfs_async(files, output_filename):
         # Show progress bar, call merge function, and update UI asynchronously.
         await asyncio.to_thread(merge_pdfs, files, output_filename)
     ```

#### 7. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - Implement try-except blocks with error messages to the user and logging for developers.

#### 8. **Metadata Handling**
   - **Preserving Metadata**: Retain metadata during the merge process:
     ```python
     def copy_metadata(source_pdf, target_pdf):
         target_pdf.add_metadata(source_pdf.metadata)
     ```

   - **Metadata Editing**: Provide a GUI option to edit metadata fields like title, author, etc., before merging.

#### 9. **Additional Features (Optional Enhancements)**
   - **Watermarking**: Add a watermark before merging using `PyPDF2`.
   - **Password Protection on Final PDF**: Allow users to set a password for the merged document.
   - **Cloud Integration**: Use cloud SDKs to upload/download PDFs from cloud storage.
   - **Email Delivery**: Use `smtplib` to send the final merged PDF via email.

### GUI Design:
We will use a combination of `tkinter` widgets (ListBox, Button, ProgressBar, etc.) to implement a user-friendly and intuitive interface. Layout management with grid or pack will make the UI adaptive.

---

### 1. **Using Threading for Background Tasks**

We will use `threading.Thread` to handle tasks like merging PDFs or preview generation in the background while keeping the Tkinter GUI responsive.

### Example Code

#### **Basic Setup for Tkinter with Threading**

```python
import threading
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox
from PyPDF2 import PdfMerger
from pdf2image import convert_from_path
from PIL import Image, ImageTk

class PDFMergerApp:
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = root
        self.root.title("PDF Merger")
        self.pdf_files = []
        
        # File upload button
        self.upload_button = tk.Button(root, text="Upload PDFs", command=self.upload_pdfs)
        self.upload_button.pack()

        # Merge button
        self.merge_button = tk.Button(root, text="Merge PDFs", command=self.start_merge_thread)
        self.merge_button.pack()

        # Save button
        self.save_button = tk.Button(root, text="Save Merged PDF", command=self.save_merged_pdf)
        self.save_button.pack()

        # Text area to show files
        self.file_listbox = tk.Listbox(root, selectmode=tk.MULTIPLE, width=50)
        self.file_listbox.pack()

        # Status message
        self.status_label = tk.Label(root, text="Status: Ready")
        self.status_label.pack()

    def upload_pdfs(self):
        files = filedialog.askopenfilenames(
            title="Select PDF files", 
            filetypes=[("PDF files", "*.pdf")]
        )
        if files:
            self.pdf_files = files
            self.file_listbox.delete(0, tk.END)
            for file in files:
                self.file_listbox.insert(tk.END, file)

    def start_merge_thread(self):
        if not self.pdf_files:
            messagebox.showwarning("Warning", "Please upload PDF files first!")
            return
        
        # Start the merging process in a new thread
        merge_thread = threading.Thread(target=self.merge_pdfs)
        merge_thread.start()

    def merge_pdfs(self):
        try:
            self.update_status("Merging PDFs...")
            merger = PdfMerger()
            for pdf in self.pdf_files:
                merger.append(pdf)
            
            # Saving the merged file to a temporary location for now
            self.merged_pdf_path = "merged_output.pdf"
            with open(self.merged_pdf_path, 'wb') as f_out:
                merger.write(f_out)
            merger.close()

            self.update_status("Merging Complete!")
            messagebox.showinfo("Success", "PDFs merged successfully!")
        except Exception as e:
            self.update_status("Failed to merge PDFs")
            messagebox.showerror("Error", str(e))

    def save_merged_pdf(self):
        if hasattr(self, 'merged_pdf_path'):
            output_file = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(
                defaultextension=".pdf", 
                filetypes=[("PDF files", "*.pdf")]
            )
            if output_file:
                try:
                    with open(self.merged_pdf_path, 'rb') as f_in:
                        with open(output_file, 'wb') as f_out:
                            f_out.write(f_in.read())
                    messagebox.showinfo("Success", f"Merged PDF saved as {output_file}")
                except Exception as e:
                    messagebox.showerror("Error", str(e))
        else:
            messagebox.showwarning("Warning", "No merged PDF available. Please merge PDFs first.")

    def update_status(self, message):
        self.status_label.config(text=f"Status: {message}")
        self.root.update_idletasks()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = PDFMergerApp(root)
    root.mainloop()
```

### Key Changes with Threading:

1. **Thread for Merging PDFs**:  
   - The `start_merge_thread()` method is called when the user clicks the "Merge PDFs" button. This method starts a new thread for the `merge_pdfs()` method, allowing the main thread (which handles the GUI) to remain responsive.
   - The merging operation is done in the background using `threading.Thread(target=self.merge_pdfs)`. 

2. **Progress and Status Update**:  
   - The `update_status()` method is used to update the status label in the GUI. It ensures that changes to the GUI from the worker thread are handled properly.
   - This keeps the user informed about whatâ€™s happening (e.g., "Merging PDFs...", "Merging Complete!").

3. **Error Handling**:  
   - Errors during the merge process are caught in a try-except block and reported to the user via a message box.

### 2. **Using Threading for PDF Preview Generation**

If you want to also include the PDF preview feature in a non-blocking manner using threads, here's how it can be done.

```python
    def start_preview_thread(self):
        if not self.pdf_files:
            messagebox.showwarning("Warning", "Please upload PDF files first!")
            return
        
        # Start preview generation in a new thread
        preview_thread = threading.Thread(target=self.generate_preview)
        preview_thread.start()

    def generate_preview(self):
        try:
            self.update_status("Generating Preview...")
            images = convert_from_path(self.pdf_files[0])  # Preview the first file for simplicity
            if images:
                img = images[0]
                img.thumbnail((200, 200))  # Resize for thumbnail view
                
                # Convert to tkinter compatible image format
                self.img_tk = ImageTk.PhotoImage(img)
                self.preview_label = tk.Label(self.root, image=self.img_tk)
                self.preview_label.pack()
                
            self.update_status("Preview Ready!")
        except Exception as e:
            self.update_status("Preview Generation Failed")
            messagebox.showerror("Error", str(e))
```

### Explanation:

- **Thread for Preview Generation**:  
  Similar to PDF merging, the preview generation is done in a separate thread (`start_preview_thread()`). This ensures that the GUI remains responsive while the images are generated.
  
- **Updating the GUI with the Preview**:  
  After generating the image, it is resized to a thumbnail and displayed using a `Label`. This part of the code ensures that the preview does not block the UI thread.

### 3. **Conclusion**

This approach with threading ensures that all long-running tasks are handled in the background, allowing the Tkinter GUI to stay responsive. You can now upload, preview, merge, and save PDFs without freezing the application, even when dealing with large files.

Here's the complete code for a PDF merging application using Python's `Tkinter`, `threading`, and other necessary libraries. This code fulfills your requirements by incorporating GUI elements, threading for background tasks, and various PDF-related functionalities like uploading, merging, and previewing.

        self.root.update_idletasks()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = PDFMergerApp(root)
    root.mainloop()
```

### **Explanation**

#### **Main Functionalities**

1. **Upload PDFs**
   - The user can select multiple PDF files through a file dialog (`filedialog.askopenfilenames()`).
   - The filenames are displayed in a listbox for visual confirmation.

2. **Merge PDFs**
   - The merging operation is performed in a background thread using `threading.Thread`. This prevents the GUI from freezing during long-running tasks.
   - A progress bar is updated as each PDF is added to the merger to provide feedback on the merging progress.
   - After merging, the status is updated and the user is informed via a message box.

3. **Save Merged PDF**
   - After merging, the user can save the merged PDF to a location of their choice using a file dialog (`filedialog.asksaveasfilename()`).

4. **Preview PDFs**
   - The first page of the first uploaded PDF is converted to an image using `pdf2image.convert_from_path()` and displayed as a thumbnail preview.
   - Preview generation is also done in a background thread to keep the UI responsive.

5. **Status and Progress Feedback**
   - The application provides status updates and feedback to the user via a label (`status_label`) and a progress bar (`progress`).

### **Dependencies**

Make sure to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install PyPDF2 pillow pdf2image
```

- **PyPDF2**: Handles the merging of PDF files.
- **pdf2image**: Converts PDF pages to images for preview purposes.
- **Pillow**: Provides image handling capabilities for the preview thumbnails.
  
Additionally, on Windows, you'll need to install the `poppler` utility to support `pdf2image`. Instructions for installation are found [here](https://github.com/Belval/pdf2image).

### **Conclusion**

This code provides a simple yet functional PDF merging application with the ability to preview the first page of a PDF. The application uses threading to ensure that the Tkinter GUI remains responsive even during intensive tasks like merging and preview generation.

---
To ensure that PDFs are merged in the correct order, you need to provide a way for users to reorder the files after they have been uploaded. I will update the code so that the user can reorder the PDFs using "Up" and "Down" buttons in the listbox.

### Updated Code to Ensure Correct PDF Order with Reordering Functionality

### Explanation of New Features

#### **Reordering Functionality**
- **Move Up Button**: Moves the selected PDF up in the listbox and updates the order in the `pdf_files` list.
- **Move Down Button**: Moves the selected PDF down in the listbox and updates the order in the `pdf_files` list.
- **refresh_listbox()**: This method clears the listbox and repopulates it to reflect the current order of the files in `pdf_files`.

#### **Threading**
- The merging and preview generation are handled in separate threads to avoid freezing the GUI while processing.

#### **Order Preservation**
- The order of the PDFs in the listbox is linked to the `pdf_files` list, so when the user clicks "Merge PDFs," the files are merged in the exact order shown in the listbox.

### Summary
This updated version provides a complete solution for merging PDFs while allowing the user to reorder them before the merge operation. The `Up` and `Down` buttons enable the user to move files up and down in the listbox, ensuring the correct order. The rest of the application, including the merging, saving, and previewing functionalities, remains consistent with the previous version.

To remove the "Preview First PDF" button and adjust the application accordingly, I'll update the code by removing the button and any associated functionality. Here's the updated code:

### What was changed?
- **Removed the Preview First PDF Button**: The button and related code for generating a preview of the first PDF have been removed. 
- **Simplified the Layout**: The GUI is now focused solely on uploading, reordering, merging, and saving the PDFs.

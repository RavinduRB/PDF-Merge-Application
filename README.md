The other day I made a PDF merging application using Python ðŸš€.

This allows you to merge any PDF you want via the "Upload PDFs" button, and you can rearrange the PDF order by clicking the "Move Up" and "Move Down" buttons.

After creating the PDF order, you can merge it by clicking the "Merge PDFs" button. You can save the PDF prepared in this way.

This was very useful for me in several works at university.
